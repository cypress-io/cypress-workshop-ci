# Cypress CircleCI Orb

## 📚 You will learn

- How to **easily** run Cypress on CircleCI
- How to run Cypress tests in parallel
- How to split build and test jobs

💡 see [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb)

---
## Motivation

You don't need to fiddle with caching, installation, flags, recording, etc. Let us (Cypress authors) write the CI configuration code.

Repo [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb)

⚠️ You might have to enable 3rd party orbs in your CircleCI settings, see [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#how-to-enable](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#how-to-enable)

### TODO: try running the simplest job

Create file `circle.yml` in the root of the repo

```yml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      # "cypress" is the name of the imported orb
      # "run" is the name of the job defined in Cypress orb
      - cypress/run:
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
```

Commit and push the code.

`start`, `wait-on` parameters [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#examples](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#examples)

### Start building

### TODO: look at CircleCI steps

find the:
- container info
- code check out
- caching
- installation
- starting the app
- running tests

---
### If you are using Yarn

```diff
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
  workflows:
    build:
      jobs:
        # "cypress" is the name of the imported orb
        # "run" is the name of the job defined in Cypress orb
        - cypress/run:
+           yarn: true
            start: npm start
            wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
```

---
### Versions

We publish orbs to CircleCI registry and to GitHub

- [circleci.com/developer/orbs](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs)
- [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb/releases](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb/releases)

Picking the version of the orb to use:

- `cypress-io/cypress@1` is the latest v1 version of the orb
- `cypress-io/cypress@1.2` is the latest v1.2 version of the orb
- `cypress-io/cypress@1.19.3` is the specific version

---
### Workspace

Cypress Orb automatically passes all files from one job to another using Cypress _workspace_. But saving it takes time.

![Successful CircleCI job](./images/all-steps.png)

+++
### Todo: remove "persisting to workspace" step

We only have the single test job, and do not intend to run any more jobs using this workspace. Thus we can skip saving the workspace to save time.

**💡 Hint:** look at the examples in [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb). Answer ⏬

+++

```yml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/run:
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
          no-workspace: true
```

`no-workspace` parameter [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#examples](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#examples)

---
### Record the test results

- Look up the project's recording key at `https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/<id>/settings`
- Add `CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY` to the CircleCI project's settings

+++
![Set CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY variable](./images/key.png)

+++
### TODO: Set the project to record

Look up the record option at [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb). Answer ⏬

**Bonus:** add tag to separate the recorded runs from CircleCI from other CIs
+++

```yml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      # "cypress" is the name of the imported orb
      # "run" is the name of the job defined in Cypress orb
      - cypress/run:
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
          no-workspace: true
          record: true
          tags: circleci
```

[github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#record-on-dashboard](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb#record-on-dashboard)

## CircleCI Orb is a text macro expansion

Can be checked statically via CircleCI CLI [https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/)

```
$ circleci config validate circle.yml
Config file at circle.yml is valid.
```
+++

But if we tried to use `tag` instead of `tags`

```
$ circleci config validate circle.yml
Error: Error calling workflow: 'build'
Error calling job: 'cypress/run'
Unexpected argument(s): tag
```
+++

We can see the "effective" config after Orb has been expanded in the workflow

```
$ circleci config process circle.yml
# Orb 'cypress-io/cypress@1' resolved to 'cypress-io/cypress@1.27.0'

### Separate the install job from the test job

Later it will allow us to run multiple test jobs in parallel

```yml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install
      - cypress/run:
          requires:
            - cypress/install
          install-command: echo 'Everything was already installed'
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
          no-workspace: true
          record: true
          tags: circleci
```

**💡 Tip:** find our CircleCI workflow recipes in [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb/blob/master/docs/recipes.md](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb/blob/master/docs/recipes.md)

+++
### Two jobs in the workflow

![Workflow with two jobs](./images/workflow.png)

+++
### Install using Yarn

```diff
- - cypress/install
+ - cypress/install:
+     yarn: true
```

---
## Parallel testing

```diff
  - cypress/run:
-     install-command: echo 'Everything was already installed'
      start: npm start
      wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
      no-workspace: true
      record: true
      tags: circleci
+     parallel: true
+     parallelism: 2
```

When we use `parallel: true` parameter, it implies no install is necessary. See [github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb](https://github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb).

We need to install dependencies using 1 job, then run multiple test jobs using the same workspace. Cypress orb saves and loads the workspace between the jobs automatically

```yml
version: 2.1
orbs:
  cypress: cypress-io/cypress@1
workflows:
  build:
    jobs:
      - cypress/install
      - cypress/run:
          requires:
            - cypress/install
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
          no-workspace: true
          record: true
          tags: circleci
          parallel: true
          parallelism: 2
```

```

**🏎 tip:** CircleCI gives 4 parallel containers for free for open source public projects.

## ⌛️ Review

- using [cypress-io/circleci-orb](github.com/cypress-io/circleci-orb) is the simplest way to install, cache, and run Cypress tests on CircleCI
- running tests in parallel is as simple as `parallelism: N`
- the orb passes the files through the workspace automatically
