# Cypress GitHub Action

## üìö You will learn

- How to **easily** run Cypress on GitHub Actions
- How to run Cypress tests in parallel
- How to split build and test jobs

üí° see [github.com/cypress-io/github-action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action)

---
## Motivation

You don't need to fiddle with caching, installation, flags, recording, etc. Let us (Cypress authors) write the CI configuration code (in JavaScript!).

```yml
# .github/workflow/ci.yml
name: ci
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõé
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Cypress tests üß™
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
        with:
          record: true
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
        env:
          # pass the record key as environment variable
          # during this CI step
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```
Use the above workflow and inspect the run.

üí° Our GH Action automatically uses `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file to pick the right install command.

## TODO: Look at the action examples

- [github.com/cypress-io/github-action#examples](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#examples) shows example for each parameter
- [github.com/cypress-io/github-action#more-examples](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action#more-examples) has links to example repositories

+++
## TODO: show cypress info

üí° Hint: use the build command parameter
+++
```yml
- name: Run Cypress tests üß™
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
  with:
    build: npx cypress info
    record: true
    start: npm start
    wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
    browser: firefox
  env:
    # pass the record key as environment variable
    # during this CI step
    CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

---
## Action versioning

- `uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2` uses the latest v2 branch of the action
- `uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2.9.3` uses specific tag
- `uses: cypress-io/github-action@dbe898` uses specific commit

---
## Run tests in parallel

- run tests faster by load balancing them across N machines
- use group names and tags
- parallelize each group separately

+++
### TODO: split spec into multiple specs

![Split into 4 specs](./images/split.png)

+++
### TODO: run a matrix of 3 machines

```yml
name: ci
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        # run 3 copies of the current job in parallel
        containers: [1, 2, 3]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõé
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Run Cypress tests üß™
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
        with:
          record: true
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
        env:
          # pass the record key as environment variable
          # during this CI step
          CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY: ${{ secrets.CYPRESS_RECORD_KEY }}
```

### What do you see?

![Same 4 specs ran on every machine](./images/same-specs.png)

+++
### Turn on parallel mode

```diff
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
  with:
    record: true
+   parallel: true
    start: npm start
    wait-on: 'http://localhost:8080'
```

**TODO:** inspect the output from each machine

+++
### Dashboard machines view

![Dashboard machines view](./images/machines.png)

---
### Recording Groups

**Todo:** move one spec into "smoke" folder

![Smoke spec and 3 other specs](./images/smoke.png)
+++
**Todo:** update the `ci.yml`

We want to run the smoke specs separately.
- first run all specs
- second run just the smoke specs
- give each group its own name

![Two groups recorded in the same run](./images/smoke-groups.png)

‚ùì How did Cypress load balance these groups?
+++
**Todo:** avoid the second install in the smoke tests

```yml
- name: Run Smoke tests üí®
  uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
  with:
    ???
    record: true
    parallel: true

```

## Separate jobs

**Todo:** have one job run all specs and another job run the smoke specs

### TODO: Split the build

- one job to build the site
  - uploads the built folder
- second job (parallel 3x) tests the site
  - downloads the built folder
  - starts the server
  - runs the tests

**Tip:** you can use Cypress GH Action to install without running tests

## ‚åõÔ∏è Review

- using [cypress-io/github-action](https://github.com/cypress-io/github-action) is the simplest way to install, cache, and run Cypress tests
- run parallel jobs to speed up the tests
- separate jobs in the workflow when makes sense
